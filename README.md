#DelTree

Script for deleting all files and folders starting at a given directory ```$dir```

Totally stole from StackOverflow but putting it here saves me Googling it every time I need it.

Useful for getting rid of PHP owned folders when you don't have sudo access.

##Usage

Upload script to wherever

Change ```$dir = 'xxxyyyzzz';``` to the directory path
E.g. ```$dir = 'assets';````

Run script

Then probably delete it / change ```$dir``` so you don't forget and trash stuff by accident.
